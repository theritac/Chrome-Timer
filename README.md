## Idea 💡 and Usage 💻
Chrome Timer is a Chrome extension that keeps track of time spent on specific tabs. The timer will count down while the user is on the tab and will pause when outside of it. The Chrome Timer is inspired by the screen time function on iPhones to prevent the overuse of technology during downtime. This can be especially helpful for those who lose track of time when on social media and entertainment sites like Instagram, Netflix, and Youtube.
